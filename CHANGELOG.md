# Changelog

All notable changes to uniplot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
### Added
- SI unit prefixes for axis labels via the new `x_unit_as_si` / `y_unit_as_si`
  options. When enabled, values are assumed to be in the base unit given by
  `x_unit` / `y_unit` and labels are rendered with the appropriate SI prefix
  (e.g. a label of `1000` with unit `" m"` becomes `1 km`, `0.003` becomes
  `3 mm`). The prefix is inserted before the first non-whitespace character of
  the unit, so a leading space is preserved; a blank unit still gets a prefix
  (e.g. `200k`). On linear axes a single prefix is chosen for the whole axis,
  anchored to the smallest nonzero label so that no label drops below 1 in the
  chosen unit (e.g. `[250, 500, 1000]` stays in grams rather than tipping into
  fractional kilograms). A prefix is only applied when it does not make the
  labels longer than the plain representation, so e.g. `0.5 °C` is kept as-is
  rather than rewritten as `500 m°C`. On log axes each label gets its own
  prefix, since the labels span several orders of magnitude. Values beyond the
  known prefix range (below yocto or above yotta) fall back to plain
  formatting.
### Changed
- Log-scale axis labels now render the actual values (e.g. `1.6`, `100`)
  instead of exponent notation (`10^0.2`, `10^2`), which also fixes fractional
  exponents previously shown as e.g. `10^-0.6`.

## [0.23.2] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- Timestamps for histogram x-axis are correctly displayed. Thanks @rossburton
  for reporting!

## [0.23.1] - 2026-06-23
### Fixed
- Thread-safety: `plot_gen.set_data()` now snapshots the supplied data
  (`xs`/`ys`) *and* any mutable option values (e.g. `lines`, `color`,
  `legend_labels`, gridlines) at call time, so it is safe to pass live,
  still-growing lists while `rich.live.Live` renders on its own thread.
  Previously the producer's later appends could desync a list from the series
  count and crash the background render thread (a length assertion for data, a
  `ValueError` for options). The snapshot is cheap (≈0.15 ms for a 1M-point
  NumPy array). Pass `set_data(..., copy=False)` to skip it when you already
  hand over fresh, private objects each call.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-06-21
### Added
- Integration with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), including support
  for live-updating displays via `rich.live.Live`. A `plot_gen` object is a Rich
  renderable and exposes a thread-safe `plot_gen.set_data(...)` for feeding new
  data without printing. Install with `pip install uniplot[rich]`.
- `plot_gen.to_string()` returns the current plot as a string without printing,
  and `plot_gen.reset_view()` resets the view window and clears pinned bounds.
### Changed
- **Breaking:** `plot_gen` was simplified. `update()` now always re-draws from
  the current state and returns the rendered string (previously returned `None`
  unless `return_string=True`). The `return_string` constructor argument has
  been removed — use `plot_gen.to_string()` / `plot_to_string()` for string
  output. Bounds set explicitly (or via interactive pan/zoom) are now *pinned*
  and preserved across data updates, while all other bounds keep auto-ranging.
- Upgraded mypy to v2.1.0 and dropped CI support for Python 3.8 and 3.9 (EOL).
### Fixed
- A style-only update on a `plot_gen` (e.g. `update(title=...)` before any data)
  no longer raises `KeyError`.
- Explicitly-set bounds are no longer wrongly carried over when the data type
  changes between updates (e.g. switching from numeric to datetime values).
- Upgraded dependencies to resolve dependabot warning on pytest /
  CVE-2025-71176. This only affects uniplot developers, not users.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-18
### Added
- 3-5x speed improvement when plotting 1M+ lines using
  [Numba JIT compilation](https://numba.pydata.org/). Numba is an optional
  dependency, that can be installed using `pip install uniplot[fast]`.

### Changed
- Merged the `force_ascii` feature into the `character_set` option. ASCII character

  `force_ascii` option.

## [0.18.1] - 2025-04-24

- Shortened, more readable datetime labels when plotting over months/years.

## [0.14.0] - 2024-08-17
### Improved
- Much improved datetime labels. Still experimental, but now using a similar
  logic as the numerical labels.

## [0.13.1] - 2024-07-06
### Added
- New option `force_ascii_characters` that controls the symbols to be used, so
  that we can plot multiple series even without Unicode or color.

### Fixed
- Legend labels were colored even with the option `color=False`. Thanks to
  @NikosAlexandris for pointing this out!

## [0.13.0] - 2024-06-08

  strings. Thanks to @PabloRuizCuevas for idea and PR!

  the PR!

## [0.12.5] - 2024-03-24
### Fixed

  independently, which just makes more sense.

## [0.12.4] - 2024-03-13
### Fixed
- Limits to bins that are passed to the histogram function via `bins_min` and
  `bins_max` now work as expected. Thanks to @riga for pointing this out!

### Fixed
- Vertical and horizontal lines that were partially out of view were not drawn
  fully. Fixed thanks to @riga

## [0.12.2] - 2024-02-23
### Added
- Experimental: Added support for plotting the y-axis as timestamps.
- Explicit conversion to string of text options. The goal here is to allow for
  other objects to be passed in, such as a machine learning model object,
  without manually creating the text label first.

## [0.12.1] - 2024-02-17
### Changed
- Nicer datetime label formatting.

## [0.12.0] - 2024-02-17
### Added

  support Unicode.
### Fixed
- Added `__all__` statement to fix language server complaint when using `from
  uniplot import plot` thanks to @h0uter

## [0.9.2] - 2023-02-19

- Manual view options are now working correctly when using log scales.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-01-19
### Added
- Data can now be plotted on a logarithmic scale.

### Fixed
- Fixed a rare issue with displaying the wrong number of digits of axis labels.

## [0.8.1] - 2022-12-19

  stdout.

## [0.4.3] - 2021-04-07
