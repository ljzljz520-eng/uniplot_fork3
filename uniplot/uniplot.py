        happens once per rendered frame rather than once per call.

        By default the supplied data *and* any mutable option values are
        snapshotted at call time, so it is safe to hand over live, still-growing

        `copy=False` to skip it when you already hand over fresh, private objects
        each call and want zero overhead.

        Accumulation across calls:

        - Options (e.g. `title`, `lines`, `color`) *accumulate*: each is kept
          until you pass that key again, so a later call need only send what
          changed. Passing a key again overwrites it (last value wins).

          *pinned* and preserved across later data updates, until `reset_view()`
          or an axis data-type change (e.g. numeric <-> datetime).
        - Data is *replaced*, not accumulated: passing `ys` swaps the whole
          series. `ys` without `xs` resets the x-axis to the serial index `1..N`
          (x and y are one coupled unit), so to keep a custom x-axis pass `xs`
          together with `ys` every time. A lone `xs` (no `ys`) is ignored.

        Note that `self.options` reflects the new data only after the next
        render (e.g. via `to_string()` or a `Live` refresh).

    The copy is intentionally shallow/structural -- an O(n) memcpy for arrays,
    one level deep for sequences -- so it stays cheap (at 1M points: ~0.15 ms
    for a NumPy array, ~2 ms for a Python list). The expensive cast/validation
    remains deferred to `_recompute`. Immutable scalars/strings (and anything we
    cannot cheaply copy) pass through unchanged.
